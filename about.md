My name is Andrew. I'm the Creative Director for Reading Room. My career started early (didn't bother with university) and has seen me involved in visual effects, teaching, digital strategy, human computer interaction, psychology, software development, and design. I get bored easily, I'm arrogant, and I'm a pain in the arse. These are my best bits.

I use design to solve business problems. That sounds both dull, and like something you'd see written on a bad resume. But good or bad it's true. Occassionally I'll find a great solution first and then I'll post rationalise that into a problem. That almost entirely works.

My clients range from tiny charities, to massive multi-national corporate leviathans. And everything inbetween.

Contact me on Twitter (@Andrew_Larking) if you feel inclined.
